Have you ever wanted a portrait of your RPG character? Well you're in luck, A very talented artist from our community called Asatina is now open for character portrait commissions.

Do you have a beloved RPG character you've been playing for years, or prehaps you just really gel with your current RPG character. The portrait does not need to be one for the event (though a cool prottrait for the event woudl be awesome too). All the proceeds from the commission will be go directly to Shelter.

Check out Asatina's examples below, along with prices and how to kick off the process with them. **Please remember when donating for one of these pieces that you can not add gift aid to your donation**.
