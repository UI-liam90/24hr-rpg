Have you ever wanted a portrait of your RPG character? Well, look no further, A very talented artist from our community called Asatina is now open for character portrait commissions.

Do you have a beloved RPG character you've been playing for years, or perhaps you just really like your current RPG character? The portrait does not need to be one for the event (though a cool portrait for the event would be awesome too). All the proceeds from the commission will go directly to this years charity, Shelter.

Check out Asatina's examples below, along with prices and how to kick off the process of getting a commission. **Please remember when donating for one of these pieces that you can not add gift aid to your donation**.
