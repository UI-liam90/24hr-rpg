A series of one-shot, quick and easy rpgs, likely switching every 2 -3 hours! You'll be signing up for the whole bunch, but this is the easiest to drop in and out of and/or have someone tag in for you.

The rpg's will be a smattering of short, quick to learn games - running the gamut of genres and themes. Last years included Alien, All out of Bubblegum, Everybody is John, Mission Accomplished, Fiasco and a ' special D&D'.

Expect much more strangeness this year!
