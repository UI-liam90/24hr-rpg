In an age of legends, before what we now consider recorded time, before the rise of the sons of Arrius, there was a time of HIGH adventure...
The Scourge has destroyed the earth, and slowly, we, the Namegivers, that survived in our Kaers, have arisen to re-take our land. 

In the small village of Heaphon the elders have a problem that needs solving. Thankfully a group of villagers have recently been trained as Adepts, magically enhanced beings, whose abilities can become greater than any normal man, they just need experience.....how fortuitous. 
Sent out into the world to solve a problem, and either make the start of a legend, or the end of a short, horrible tale....
