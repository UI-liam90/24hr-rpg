Welcome to Gramophere, home to the fantasy competition called LootQuest!

In Gramophere, LootQuest is a magically transmitted show, watched by millions, where two teams of adventurers compete each week to loot a mirror dungeon, the team who comes out with the most loot at end of the show wins!

You are this year's underdog team, The Koala Sheep! Through perseverance and determination you have risen through the competition to this the final to take on the two year reining champions, The Dragon Newts!

How will you fair, and can you bring The Koala Sheep to victory?

A silly adventure for 3-6 players. Run using the Powered by Apocalypse framework, with silly class choices to choose from. Expect a mix of puzzle solving, minion and boss encounters, and roleplay. Split into 3 dungoen floors of 8 hours each, so folks can drop in and out between floors.
