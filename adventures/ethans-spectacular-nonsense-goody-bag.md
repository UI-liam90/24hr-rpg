This is a series of one-shot, quick and easy rpgs, likely switching every 2 -3 hours!
You'll be signing up for the whole bunch, but this is the easiest to drop in and out of.

The games Include, but are not limited to:

- Honey Heist ( A team of bears go on the heist of the century!)
- Everybody is John ( Players are the multiple personalities of a particularly deranged man)
- Alien ( A happy-go-lucky alien monstrosity makes some new friends!)
- Fiasco ( Things go drastically wrong for everyone, everywhere, ever)
- Paranoia ( Trust the Computer. The Computer is your FRiend)
- Bigfoot stole my car ( Bigfoot has stolen your car on the way to your friends bat-mitzvah, get it back!)
- Etc, etc.

You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only use the edge!
