Necromancy! Treason! Gnomes!

Deep underneath the City of Towers, a group of adventurers wait for a gnone offering work that walk the line between justice and chaos. A whirlwind and (somewhat) lighthearted jaunt across Khorvaire culminating in a heist from the most guarded place on Eberron. This 24hr adventure covers levels 3-9.
