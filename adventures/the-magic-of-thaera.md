In a small cosy town in middle America a group of teenage friends find a mystical board game that turns them from teenagers to fantasy heroes! But with every roll of the dice the magical world takes a greater hold. Can these kids defeat the evils that threaten to destroy their town or will the magical land of Thaera swallow it whole!

5e dnd game from levels 3-6.

A healthy mix of roleplay, puzzles and combat.
