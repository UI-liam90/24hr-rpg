Western 5e, using DEMs Ultra Modern Redux (Ultramax) Rules. 6 players. Run live over two 12 hour days, on the 17th and 18 of September. 

The town of Promise is starting to grow, finally, and all is looking up, until some varmint decided to cause trouble. The towns major personages all need to sort this out, and quick. If the railroad inspectors, due presently, see the town ain't safe, they may just route it elsewhere. Expect adult themes in a rootin' tootin' round up of unusual western style.
