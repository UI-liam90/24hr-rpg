Welcome new and returning Players

So you're interested in playing this year?

Well below you will find all the information you require to be a player at the 2022 24 hour RPG challenge.

## How do I become a Player?
To become a player, you simply need to bid for the RPG session you want to play in. When the games are announced later in July there will be a form available to bid for your chosen game. Bidding will close on September 1st.

## How much should I bid?
That is completely up to yourself, there is no minimum bid amount. The higher you bid the more likely you are to secure a place in the game you want to play, but don’t worryz

## Does my bid secure me ‘a place at the table’?
As you are bidding for your place, then until bidding closes your place is not secure at the table. If when bidding closes your bid is one of the top bids within the player cap for the game, then you will have a place at the table. Until bidding has closed, please do not pay your bid to the just giving page, unless you are happy giving the money regardless of your position at the table.

## Do I have to play a game for a full 24 hours?
Though it is meant to be a challenge run over in a single 24 hours, over the years we have diverged to include some more accessible formats. We have also had GM's run:
- 2 x 12 hours - 2 sessions over the Saturday and Sunday of the event
- 12 hour - where the GM has run one 12 session.
So in summary, check the game information, as there may be games which are running in different formats from the 24 hours format.

## Is this year's event online or offline?
This year we're going with a hybrid approach and allowing GMs the choice to run online or offline. Due to the rising number of COVID infections we advise sticking to an online structure like last year’s event, but ultimately the choice is yours.

For those playing offline we DO NOT have a centralised venue like in previous years, so offline players will need to find GM’s local to themselves. This is due to our encouragement to playing online, but mainly due to the costs associated with renting a central location to play from (which monies we felt would be better going towards the charity instead).

For those playing online, we would love for you to stream your game on Twitch, Youtube or similar streaming services, but this is not an absolute requirement (just helps to keep supporters involved). Help and guidance will be available for setting up a stream soon.

## I can’t do the 24th September 2022, but still I want to play, can I play on a different date?
Our main focus is to raise money for charity, and as such we have opened it up this year for GM’s to run on a different date within September. So if you want to do the challenge as a player but can’t play on the 24th September 2022 then keep an eye out for games running on different dates!
