						<p>Welcome warriors, both keyboard and otherwise, The 24HR RPG challenge is back for another year of crazy adventures!</p>

						<p>This year we're supporting Shelter. Times are tough for all, but no one should feel the threat of losing there home. That is why we invite gamers of every flavour to join together and raise money to support Shelter in keeping the nation housed and safe.</p>

						<p>We are aiming for a hybrid setup this years with both physical and online games happening, welcoming individual streamers as well as traditional RPG groups. We encourage those online to stream their games on the day via Twitch, YouTube, UStream or any other suitable service.</p>

						<p>Every group should also set up a JustGiving page, by clicking the Join Team button at <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/team/24-hour-rpg">https://www.justgiving.com/team/24-hour-rpg</a>, so all donations go to the same place. You will need to create your own just giving page first.</p>

						<p>Any players at one of the RPG tables will need to bid real money to gain their seat, with the highest bids taking a place in the game. Those streaming videogames, or other activities are less restricted in that regard, but are still very much encouraged raise as much money as they can. GM's and individual streamers don't have to bid (unless they really want to), but everyone is of course strongly encouraged to get as many sponsors as possible.</p>

						<p>Some games may even allow there sponsor the opportunity to help or hinder their chosen beneficiary through their donations. For every Â£5 given, a sponsor can inflict a Friend or a Foe token, to help or hinder their efforts. Maybe it will give them a reroll, or an extra chance. Maybe the monsters get another attack in, or they are forced to stand still for a bit longer than they should.</p>
